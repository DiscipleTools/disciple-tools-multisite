# Disciple Tools Multisite
This plugin is highly recommended for administrators running a multisite wordpress / Disciple Tools installation. It adds
special administrative tools for multisite Disciple Tools systems. These tools help the Super Admin of a multisite server maintain and protect a system with many Disciple Tools systems. They also extend multi-site capacity to key plugins like the Network Dashboard.
